    "# Sentiment Analysis with TreeLSTMs in TensorFlow Fold\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html) is a corpus of ~10K one-sentence movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. The sentences have been parsed into binary trees with words at the leaves; every sub-tree has a label ranging from 0 (highly negative) to 4 (highly positive); 2 means neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `(4 (2 Spiderman) (3 ROCKS))` is sentence with two words, corresponding a binary tree with three nodes. The label at the root, for the entire sentence, is `4` (highly positive). The label for the left child, a leaf corresponding to the word `Spiderman`, is `2` (neutral). The label for the right child, a leaf corresponding to the word `ROCKS` is `3` (moderately positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use TensorFlow Fold train a model on the treebank using binary TreeLSTMs and [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) word embedding vectors, as described in the paper [Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00075.pdf) by Tai et al. The original [Torch](http://torch.ch) source code for the model, provided by the authors, is available [here](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/treelstm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model illustrates three of the more advanced features of Fold, namely:\n",
    "1. [Compositions](https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/blocks.md#wiring-things-together-in-more-complicated-ways) to wire up blocks to form arbitrary directed acyclic graphs\n",
    "2. [Forward Declarations](https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/blocks.md#recursion-and-forward-declarations) to create recursive blocks\n",
    "3. [Metrics](https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/py/td.md#class-tdmetric) to create models where the size of the output is not fixed, but varies as a function of the input data."
